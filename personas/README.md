Scenario: Ronnie has had apple music for many years, but recently his mom purchased a family plan for spotify, after all college is expensive and free is better than 15$/month.  He is too lazy to take the time to remake all of his playlists on the new platform, but he still wants to listen to them.

Scenario: He uses youtube for free music and plays radios from it. Recently, John’s family helped sign him up for a music streaming service. He would like to be able to transfer his music from his youtube account to this new streaming service.

Scenario:  She has always used free streaming, but the ads keep interrupting her workflow, so she has opted for a spotify membership.  She is too busy to make playlists but her friend Sarah has offered to share her playlists. The problem is that Sarah is a youtube music user, so she can't send her playlists without remaking them by hand.

Scenario: Amber’s parents recently added her to the family’s music streaming service plan after she begged and said that all of her friends were also getting one. Amber, as a 13 year old girl, does not have the most developed taste in music so most of her songs and playlists come from people around her. She would like to be able to share her playlists with her friends who use other streaming services.

Scenario: Kyle’s friends are going to a convention with him and want to share all their music. He has a couple of different places that he wants to share but has to keep switching between services.
