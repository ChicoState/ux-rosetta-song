# Phase II: Refining interaction and designing wireframes

## Introduction

Our report last left the team with a single button on a page. All of our questions/objectives were lingering except linking Spotify. Our software engineers have been focused on adding account verification for various services, which now are able to verify and login users into Youtube and Spotify. This sprint primarily focused on creating a higher fidelity version of our application, and taking note of how users would interact with the software. This allowed us to make changes to our design to make it as easy as possible for users to accomplish their goals.

## Methods

!!! Describe research methods you used to discover new insights, which explains the purpose of each. Provide enough detail that someone would be able to faithfully reproduce your research. !!!

## Conclusions

!!! Discoveries derived from the methods and their findings. Interpret how the findings translate into new insights into UX design recommendations. Describe those recommendations and how they should shape future work. In this section, include the new design recommendations based on the latest user insights. !!!

## Caveats

!!! Considerations and/or limitations to the methods you chose and the findings/conclusions drawn from them. In other words, give warnings if there are limitations to your research such as not being able to find enough users of a particular demographic, the methods not being able to expose certain information, assumptions you made, etc. !!!
### Cognitive walkthrough
One caveat of the performed cognitive walkthroughs is that the wireframe was not finished at the time of review. While the input is still helpful, many of the personas ran into the same issues. This limited the scope of the feedback. Another caveat is inherent to all cognitive walkthroughs, and it is that the person performing the cognitive walkthrough is making an assumption of the user's knowledge, which may not perfectly align with the target persona. Another caveat is that wireframes are, by nature, not complete as the full application, and there may be some aspects that have an effect on usability, such as buttons that are clickable, and this can affect the feedback received.

### Informal Feedback
The most glaring caveat regarding the informal feedback is the audience that we recieved the feedback from.  The average user is not a computer science student, so only asking computer science students can skew results away from feedback that would otherwise represent the average user.  Another similar issue is sample size, which could lead to misunderstanding the user's wants and needs, without consulting a larger audience.  Another caveat is that students within a class may not be as critical of their peers' work compared to someone on the outside who ius completely unbiased.
