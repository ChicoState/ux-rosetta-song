# Phase II: Refining interaction and designing wireframes

## Introduction

Our report last left the team with a single button on a page. All of our questions/objectives were lingering except linking Spotify. Our software engineers have been focused on adding account verification for various services, which now are able to verify and login users into Youtube and Spotify. This sprint primarily focused on creating a higher fidelity verion of our application, and taking note of how users would ineract with the software. This allowed us to make changes to our design to make it as easy as possible for users to accomplish their goals.

## Methods

!!! Describe research methods you used to discover new insights, which explains the purpose of each. Provide enough detail that someone would be able to faithfully reproduce your research. !!!

## Findings

!!! For each research method, detail each of the findings point-by-point to clarify new discoveries of users' needs !!!

## Conclusions

!!! Discoveries derived from the methods and their findings. Interpret how the findings translate into new insights into UX design recommendations. Describe those recommendations and how they should shape future work. In this section, include the new design recommendations based on the latest user insights. !!!

## Caveats

!!! Considerations and/or limitations to the methods you chose and the findings/conclusions drawn from them. In other words, give warnings if there are limitations to your research such as not being able to find enough users of a particular demographic, the methods not being able to expose certain information, assumptions you made, etc. !!!
