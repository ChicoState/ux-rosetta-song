# Phase II: Refining interaction and designing wireframes

## Introduction

Our report last left the team with a single button on a page. All of our questions and objectives were lingering except linking Spotify. Our software engineers have been focused on adding account verification for various services, which now are able to verify and login users into Youtube and Spotify. This sprint primarily focused on creating a higher fidelity version of our application, and taking note of how users would interact with the software. This allowed us to make changes to our design to make it as easy as possible for users to accomplish their goals.

## Methods

### Cognitive walkthrough
!!!FILL IN FOR COGNITIVE WALKTHROUGH

### Informal Feedback
When our software team demonstrated the progress of the development of the Rosetta Song app, they asked the class a few questions to try to gauge what users would like implemented into the app. The response from the software class was used as informal feedback in order to make design decisions. The software team asked the questions in person while showing the progress on the app. They then relayed the class's response to the UX team in order to determine findings and draw conclusions. The exact questions the software team asked were: What music services other than Apple Music, Spotify or Youtube Music do you use, if any?, If a song title has multiple listings with different artists, would you rather have the song automatically be grabbed or asked for a specific version? (example: cover songs, remixes, etc), Would you be interested in the addition of podcasts for this application?


## Findings

!!! For each research method, detail each of the findings point-by-point to clarify new discoveries of users' needs !!!

## Conclusions

!!! Discoveries derived from the methods and their findings. Interpret how the findings translate into new insights into UX design recommendations. Describe those recommendations and how they should shape future work. In this section, include the new design recommendations based on the latest user insights. !!!

## Caveats
### Cognitive walkthrough
One caveat of the performed cognitive walkthroughs is that the wireframe was not finished at the time of review. While the input is still helpful, many of the personas ran into the same issues. This limited the scope of the feedback. Another caveat is inherent to all cognitive walkthroughs, and it is that the person performing the cognitive walkthrough is making an assumption of the user's knowledge, which may not perfectly align with the target persona. Another caveat is that wireframes are, by nature, not complete as the full application, and there may be some aspects that have an effect on usability, such as buttons that are clickable, and this can affect the feedback received.

### Informal Feedback
The most glaring caveat regarding the informal feedback is the audience that we recieved the feedback from.  The average user is not a computer science student, so only asking computer science students can skew results away from feedback that would otherwise represent the average user.  Another similar issue is sample size, which could lead to misunderstanding the user's wants and needs, without consulting a larger audience.  Another caveat is that students within a class may not be as critical of their peers' work compared to someone on the outside who ius completely unbiased.
