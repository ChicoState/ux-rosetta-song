# Phase II: Refining interaction and designing wireframes

## Introduction

Our report last left the team with a single button on a page. All of our questions and objectives were lingering except linking Spotify. Our software engineers have been focused on adding account verification for various services, which now are able to verify and log users into Youtube and Spotify. This sprint primarily focused on creating a higher fidelity version of our application and taking note of how users would interact with the software. This allowed us to make changes to our design to make it as easy as possible for users to accomplish their goals.

## Wireframe

## Methods

### Cognitive walkthrough
Our Usability Engineering team worked on developing a couple of wireframes. These wireframes then had Cognitive Walkthroughs done on them based on the personas we created in phase 1. We had five Cognitive Walkthroughs done on our wireframes by the other Usability Engineers in our class. These engineers selected a persona from the list of personas and attempted the task that the persona would have wanted to have completed. The personas that were done by those engineers were Amber Green, Jessica Conner, John Bill, Ronnie Johnson, and Kyle Mcfowl. These personas are meant to represent possible users and the goals that those people would want to accomplish. The overall purpose of these walkthroughs is to find the areas of ease and problems within our designs. 

### Informal Feedback
When our software team demonstrated the progress of the development of the Rosetta Song app, they asked the class a few questions to try to gauge what users would like implemented into the app. The response from the software class was used as informal feedback in order to make design decisions. The software team asked the questions in person while showing the progress of the app. They then relayed the class's response to the UX team in order to determine findings and draw conclusions. The exact questions the software team asked were: "What music services other than Apple Music, Spotify, or YouTube Music do you use, if any?", "If a song title has multiple listings with different artists, would you rather have the song automatically be grabbed or asked for a specific version? (example: cover songs, remixes, etc)", and "Would you be interested in the addition of podcasts for this application?"


## Findings

### Cognitive walkthrough
The Cognitive Walkthroughs that were provided for our team gave great insights into our possible failures and successes. To begin, for our persona Amber Green who was evaluated by Lizet Gutierrez, we learned that Amber's task of sharing playlists through the site is currently not achievable. For the next person, we have Jessica Conner, who was evaluated by Anthony Pecoraro, where we learned that Jessica would follow the intended first steps of the site because they showed progression toward the goal. Ultimately, Jessica was unable to complete her goal due to the state of the wireframes at that time. The next person is John Bill, who was evaluated by Dominick Duran, where we learned that confirmation pages for playlist transfer will help clear some user confusion. The next person Ronnie Johnson, who was evaluated by Eric Galvan, we learned there needs to be clear indications of the transferring of music from one service to another. The last personna Kyle Mcfowl, that was evaluated by Rey Cuesta, we learned our page's simple design allows users to infer the use of items amoung the page.

### Informal Feedback
From the informal feedback, we were able to determine that the main platforms preferred by users were Spotify and Apple Music, YouTube Music, and some mentions from Soundcloud, Amazon Music, Tidal, and Antennapod. We were also informed that users would like to be prompted and asked which version of a song should be added to the new service when the new service has multiple of the same song (cover songs, remixes, etc), but there was also some feedback saying that users might like a toggle for this feature. Users were in favor of podcasts also being moved between services in the future.

## Conclusions

### Cognitive walkthrough
Based on the Cognitive Walkthroughs that we recieved from our fellow Usability engineers, we can conclude that the progression of pages needs to be obvious and responsive. The issue that we have recieved the most during the Cognitive walkthroughs is that the system can seem some what unresponsive when the user would interact with it. When transferring playlists, users were unaware of when the transfer actually took place or if the transfer even happened to the correct service. Since most of our personnas mainly focus on adding or exchanging playlists, our wireframes were firstly focused on those features. This meant that personnas such as Amber's were ultimately harder to implement in the wireframes for the exercise. 

### Informal Feedback
Based on the informal feedback we can conclude that while many streaming services would make great additions to the Rosetta Song app, YouTube Music, Apple Music, and Spotify are by far the most prevalent, and these three platforms are much higher priority to get working. When asked, reviewers said that they wanted to be prompted for which version of each song that is being transferred, however, most popular songs have multiple versions. This would likely become tedious and take away from user experience. We have decided that a toggle switch for this feature should be available for those who want it, but it will be turned off by default, and instead select the most popular version of each given song.


## Caveats
### Cognitive walkthrough
One caveat of the performed cognitive walkthroughs is that the wireframe was not finished at the time of review. While the input is still helpful, many of the personas ran into the same issues. This limited the scope of the feedback. Another caveat is inherent to all cognitive walkthroughs, and it is that the person performing the cognitive walkthrough is making an assumption of the user's knowledge, which may not perfectly align with the target persona. Another caveat is that wireframes are, by nature, not as complete as the full application, and there may be some aspects that affect usability, such as buttons that are clickable, and this can affect the feedback received.

### Informal Feedback
The most glaring caveat regarding the informal feedback is the audience that we received the feedback from.  The average user is not a computer science student, so only asking computer science students can skew results away from feedback that would otherwise represent the average user.  Another similar issue is sample size, which could lead to misunderstanding the user's wants and needs, without consulting a larger audience.  Another caveat is that students within a class may not be as critical of their peers' work compared to someone on the outside who is completely unbiased.
