# Phase III: Prototypes and User Testing

## Introduction

Phase III's sole purpose was to test the Rosetta Song prototype with a user test. By conducting user tests, our team aims to identify user preferences, find problematic aspects of the prototype, and note opportunities for improvement in the prototype's design and functionality.

## Methods

!!! Describe research methods you used to discover new insights, which explains the purpose of each. Provide enough detail that someone would be able to faithfully reproduce your research. !!!

## Findings

!!! For each research method, detail each of the findings point-by-point to clarify new discoveries of users' needs !!!

## Conclusions

!!! Discoveries derived from the methods and their findings. Interpret how the findings translate into new insights into UX design recommendations. Describe those recommendations and how they should shape future work. In this section, include the new design recommendations based on the latest user insights. !!!

## Caveats

All participants of the study are college aged usability students, so they potentially may have interacted with the prototype differently than a random subset of participants would have. Each participant took part in multiple user tests, so the later participants may have been fatigued from the previous studies. The Rosetta Song study had seven participants, so the impact of a small sample size could have had an effect on the results of the study.
