# Phase III: Prototypes and User Testing

## Introduction

!!! Describe the general problem that the project is trying to solve and the focus of this interval of work !!!

## Methods

!!! Describe research methods you used to discover new insights, which explains the purpose of each. Provide enough detail that someone would be able to faithfully reproduce your research. !!!

## Findings

!!! For each research method, detail each of the findings point-by-point to clarify new discoveries of users' needs !!!

## Conclusions

!!! Discoveries derived from the methods and their findings. Interpret how the findings translate into new insights into UX design recommendations. Describe those recommendations and how they should shape future work. In this section, include the new design recommendations based on the latest user insights. !!!

## Caveats

All participants of the study are college aged usability students, so they potentially may have acted differently than a random subset of participants based on their understanding of usability. Each participant took part of multiple prototype studies, so the later participants may have been fatigued from the previous studies. The Rosetta Song study had seven participants, so the impact of the small sample size could have had an impact on the results of the study.
