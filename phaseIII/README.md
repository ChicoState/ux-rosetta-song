# Phase III: Prototypes and User Testing

## Introduction

Phase III's sole purpose was to test the Rosetta Song prototype with a user test. By conducting user tests, our team aims to identify user preferences, find problematic aspects of the prototype, and note opportunities for improvement in the prototype's design and functionality.

## Methods


## Findings

All of our tests had extremely high ratings from the partisipants in terms of statisfaction (greater than 4.5/5 average) except for our task 1, which had an average of 3.86/5. When taking an average of all task ratings, the average came out to exactly 4.5/5 across all task, and the average standard deviation was 0.903. Task 1 and task 3 were the only tasks to specifically be given criticism in the debrief, but task 1 much more so. A majority of participants either listed their least favorite part of the experience as the "transfer cart" or the "profile section". Task 1 also had the highest standard deviation at 1.35, and had by far the most amount of variation in scores, along with task 3, which had the second highest standard deviation at 1.133.  Task 2 and 4 both had a satisfaction rate of over 4.7/5 and a standard deviation of under 0.8. Every task was completed in under 5 minutes, and many participants completed tasks in under 1 minute, making the average time under 3 minutes per task.

!!!We still need to include the durations and failures, along with more info with the debrief


## Conclusions

!!! Discoveries derived from the methods and their findings. Interpret how the findings translate into new insights into UX design recommendations. Describe those recommendations and how they should shape future work. In this section, include the new design recommendations based on the latest user insights. !!!

## Caveats

All participants of the study are college aged usability students, so they potentially may have interacted with the prototype differently than a random subset of participants would have. Each participant took part in multiple user tests, so the later participants may have been fatigued from the previous studies. The Rosetta Song study had seven participants, so the impact of a small sample size could have had an effect on the results of the study.
