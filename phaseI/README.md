# Phase I: Analyzing Users, Competitors, and Initial Designs

## Introduction
## Phase I: Analyzing Users, Competitors, and Initial Designs
Rosetta Song is an app that is trying to bridge the gaps that seperates users of different music streaming services, so they are able to interact as one big community.  This primarily means that users with playlists on one platform will now be able to share their playlists with users on other platform with very little effort.  The focus of phase one was primarily focused on deciding what features would be needed to make Rosetta Song stand out from its competators.

## Methods

!!! Describe research methods you used to discover new insights, which explains the purpose of each. Provide enough detail that someone would be able to faithfully reproduce your research. !!!

### Heuristic Evaluation
Each member of the Rosetta Song UX team perform a heuristic evaluation on the most popular competor in out market, in the scope of playlists transfering, this is a subscription based web app called Soundiz.  We used Jakob Neilson's 10 heuristics as the parameters of our evaluation. We then compared the scores and information provided by each member to draw conclusions. The purpose of heuristic evaluation was to find places where competators have done well, as well as where they have done poorly to ensure that we don't have the same issues that they do.

### Competitive Analysis

## Findings

!!! For each research method, detail each of the findings point-by-point to clarify new discoveries of users' needs !!!

### Heuristic Evaluation
The Heuristic evaluation revealed many pros about Soundiz, but we were able to conclude the heuristic categories where it was lacking; those being: error prevention, match between system and real life, and helping users diagnose and recover from errors.

## Conclusions

!!! Discoveries derived from the methods and their findings. Interpret how the findings translate into new insights into UX design recommendations. Describe those recommendations and how they should shape future work. In this section, include the new design recommendations based on the latest user insights. !!!

## Caveats

!!! Considerations and/or limitations to the methods you chose and the findings/conclusions drawn from them. In other words, give warnings if there are limitations to your research such as not being able to find enough users of a particular demographic, the methods not being able to expose certain information, assumptions you made, etc. !!!

One major caveat that we encountered was our inibility to access the full version of the apps that we evaluated heuristically, and instead had to score said apps using the functionality that is available with the free versions.  We also took into account user reviews online to replace some of the accessability that we missed by using the free version.
