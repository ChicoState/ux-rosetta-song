# Phase I: Analyzing Users, Competitors, and Initial Designs

## Introduction
## Phase I: Analyzing Users, Competitors, and Initial Designs
Rosetta Song is an app that is trying to bridge the gaps that seperates users of different music streaming services, so they are able to interact as one big community.  This primarily means that users with playlists on one platform will now be able to share their playlists with users on other platform with very little effort.  The focus of phase one was primarily focused on deciding what features would be needed to make Rosetta Song stand out from its competators.

## Methods

!!! Describe research methods you used to discover new insights, which explains the purpose of each. Provide enough detail that someone would be able to faithfully reproduce your research. !!!

### Heuristic Evaluation
Each member of the Rosetta Song UX team performed a heuristic evaluation on the most popular competor in out market. In the scope of playlists transfering, this is a subscription based web app called Soundiz.  We used Jakob Neilson's 10 heuristics as the parameters of our evaluation. We then compared the scores and information provided by each member to draw conclusions. The purpose of heuristic evaluation was to find places where competators have done well, as well as where they have done poorly to ensure that we don't have the same issues that they do.

### Competitive Analysis
The Rosetta Song UX team performed a compeitive analysis where we first gathered competitive products. We then examined strengths, weaknesses, a quality level ranging from high to low, the price or cost of using the service and where this service was accessible from. The purpose of the competitive analysis was to identify competitors and examine their products to inform our design process. This process also helped us define what are target demographic is for our product.

### Personas and Scenarios
Our team worked together to create several personas and scenarios to help us better understand our target demographic. Using broad generalizations of possible users, we created five distinct personas covering a wide range of important qualities such as age, profession, and hobbies. It is important that we understand the backgrounds of people who could potentially be using our product so we can cater the experience to them. We then put each persona into an individual scenario that could lead to the use of our product. This process can help us focus the scope of our project and define the specific context associated with our Rosetta Song product.

### Design Structure
Each member of our team designed rough sketches of what our product could look like. After coming together and analyzing the sketches, we settled on two rough outlines of a basic model of our product. These sketches consisted of displays of our home screen and service layout, as well as an idea for a sign-in process. Within this, we also included a possible error system regarding duplicate or unfound songs. We did this to generate ideas and provide our software engineering team with a rough idea of what we could expect the product to look like.

### User Feedback
The Rosetta Song UX team designed three questions to ask users that would help us define some of our products features. These included playing music locally, service options, and how to handle song errors. We have provided our software engineers this list of questions to present at their first demonstraion.

## Findings

!!! For each research method, detail each of the findings point-by-point to clarify new discoveries of users' needs !!!

### Heuristic Evaluation
The Heuristic evaluation revealed many pros about Soundiz, but we were able to conclude the heuristic categories where it was lacking; those being: error prevention, match between system and real life, flexibility of use and helping users diagnose and recover from errors. Many of the user reviews of the paid version mentioned a specific catestrophic error that was irreversable.

### Competitive Analysis
The competitive analysis helped our team establish the current problem solution domain. This allowed us to determine that users want clean sites that provide the basic features without pay walls. This includes proper transfer between services, user customization, communication between users and general setup. Some issues on sites included users losing all playlist on all services which means basic functionality is vital.

### Personas and Scenarios
The personas and scenarios helped our team better understand our target demographic and possible use situations. Our research showed us how wide our range of users could be and showed us that we have to think a little broader in terms of demographics. However, regardless of persona, we noticed that the scenarios we all relatively similar. Most users would be using our product for one specific purpose. These insights led to new ideas for product features and design.

### Design Structure
Our sketches allowed our team to lay a foundation for the product design moving forward. We were able to come to a collective agreement on how our product should look and work as we continue to design it.

### User Feedback
Although we answered our own questions and provided some insight, the questions are meant for the first demonstration of our product which we will not be receiving any feedback for at this moment. We hope the feedback provides us with ideas for new features and changes for planned features.

## Conclusions

!!! Discoveries derived from the methods and their findings. Interpret how the findings translate into new insights into UX design recommendations. Describe those recommendations and how they should shape future work. In this section, include the new design recommendations based on the latest user insights. !!!

### Heuristic Evaluation
Due to the nature of the small transfer playlist market, there are not many innnovations that can be made wihtout complicating the simple proccess of moving playlists between streaming services, however there are a number of things that need to be avoided in order to be better than competators. The most glaring issue that the top competator had was major errors and a lack of support for fixing them. The starting point for this issue would be to include a confirm screen and a warning for potentially ireversable actions. Another big thing our team noticed was the lack of customization for the user. Much of the app looked good, but a couple of the menus were notably laid out poorly and no way to move them around like there would be on a streaming service like spotify. A basic level of customization would fix a majority of this issue. Features like a way to search or sort the playlist tiles would drastically improve the flexibility of use for an app in this space.

### Competitive Analysis
Looking into the problem solution domain allowed us to discover the current issues and what people are enjoying about the services. One early discovery from our competitive analysis is that this product is desired for the problem domain. The main issues surrounding the solution domain is actual functionality. Many issues users had with other solutions were based around incomplete functionality and inability to transfer between certain services. These services also offered little user customization for playlists. Some positives from these other products were user statistics, allowing users to play music on the site or application, and sharing playlists with other users. Using this, our designs should focus functionality then work to allow users to customize playlists, see playlist and song statistics, allow users to play music through the site and allow sharing through the site. 

### Personas and Scenarios
Our research within personas and scenarios opened our eyes to the simplicity of our product. Upon seeing that many of our scenarios were similar, we concluded that our original product might be too simple and not unique enough to set us apart from our competitors. We did not have a way to draw the user back into our product after they used it the first time. Most cases were just one user moving their playlists from one service to another and then being done with our product. This was great information because it led to many new ideas that would not only add more features to our product but also differentiate us from the competitors.

### Design Structure
Upon mapping the process of our product, we made several insights that affected its future design. One of our sketches showed a possible error scenario that occurs when there is an error with songs. We had not thought of this situation prior and it led to one of our user questions that asks the user what should happen when a song errors. Our sketches also revealed multiple options for the sharing feature of our product. We have seen examples of playlists being created within the product, and also directly into the streaming service. We were unsure of what would be the best so we turned this issue into a user question as well. 

### User Feedback
Our user questions have not been presented to users at this time so our insights are very little. These questions should help us identify what services we should prioritize including in our product and the basic features that are essential for a smooth experience.

## Caveats

!!! Considerations and/or limitations to the methods you chose and the findings/conclusions drawn from them. In other words, give warnings if there are limitations to your research such as not being able to find enough users of a particular demographic, the methods not being able to expose certain information, assumptions you made, etc. !!!

One major caveat that we encountered was our inibility to access the full version of the apps that we evaluated heuristically, and instead had to score said apps using the functionality that is available with the free versions.  We also took into account user reviews online to replace some of the accessability that we missed by using the free version.
