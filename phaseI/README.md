# Phase I: Analyzing Users, Competitors, and Initial Designs

## Introduction
## Phase I: Analyzing Users, Competitors, and Initial Designs
Rosetta Song is an app that is trying to bridge the gaps that seperates users of different music streaming services, so they are able to interact as one big community.  This primarily means that users with playlists on one platform will now be able to share their playlists with users on other platform with very little effort.  The focus of phase one was primarily focused on deciding what features would be needed to make Rosetta Song stand out from its competators.

## Methods

!!! Describe research methods you used to discover new insights, which explains the purpose of each. Provide enough detail that someone would be able to faithfully reproduce your research. !!!

### Heuristic Evaluation
Each member of the Rosetta Song UX team perform a heuristic evaluation on the most popular competor in out market. in the scope of playlists transfering, this is a subscription based web app called Soundiz.  We used Jakob Neilson's 10 heuristics as the parameters of our evaluation. We then compared the scores and information provided by each member to draw conclusions. The purpose of heuristic evaluation was to find places where competators have done well, as well as where they have done poorly to ensure that we don't have the same issues that they do.

### Competitive Analysis
The Rosetta Song UX team performed a compeitive analysis where we first gathered competitive products. We then examined strengths, weaknesses, a quality level ranging from high to low, the price or cost of using the service and where this service was accessible from. The purpose of the competitive analysis was to identify competitors and examine their products to inform our design process. This process also helped us define what are target demographic is for our product.

## Findings

!!! For each research method, detail each of the findings point-by-point to clarify new discoveries of users' needs !!!

### Heuristic Evaluation
The Heuristic evaluation revealed many pros about Soundiz, but we were able to conclude the heuristic categories where it was lacking; those being: error prevention, match between system and real life, flexibility of use and helping users diagnose and recover from errors. Many of the user reviews of the paid version mentioned a specific catestrophic error that was irreversable.

### Competitive Analysis
The competitive analysis helped our team establish the current problem solution domain. This allowed us to determine that users want clean sites that provide the basic features without pay walls.

## Conclusions

!!! Discoveries derived from the methods and their findings. Interpret how the findings translate into new insights into UX design recommendations. Describe those recommendations and how they should shape future work. In this section, include the new design recommendations based on the latest user insights. !!!

### Heuristic Evaluation
Due to the nature of the small transfer playlist market, there are not many innnovations that can be made wihtout complicating the simple proccess of moving playlists between streaming services, however there are a number of things that need to be avoided in order to be better than competators. The most glaring issue that the top competator had was major errors and a lack of support for fixing them. The starting point for this issue would be to include a confirm screen and a warning for potentially ireversable actions. Another big thing our team noticed was the lack of customization for the user. Much of the app looked good, but a couple of the menus were notably laid out poorly and no way to move them around like there would be on a streaming service like spotify. A basic level of customization would fix a majority of this issue. Features like a way to search or sort the playlist tiles would drastically improve the flexibility of use for an app in this space.


### Competative Analysis


## Caveats

!!! Considerations and/or limitations to the methods you chose and the findings/conclusions drawn from them. In other words, give warnings if there are limitations to your research such as not being able to find enough users of a particular demographic, the methods not being able to expose certain information, assumptions you made, etc. !!!

One major caveat that we encountered was our inibility to access the full version of the apps that we evaluated heuristically, and instead had to score said apps using the functionality that is available with the free versions.  We also took into account user reviews online to replace some of the accessability that we missed by using the free version.
