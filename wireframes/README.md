## Rosetta Song Greeting Page

This is the front page that our users will see when they first visit Rosetta Song. On this page, we have a brief description about our service, with a picture and the supported services. From here our users will click the button in the top right of the page to log in or sign up.

## Rosetta Song Sign-in / Sign-up

After the homepage, our users of Rosetta Song will be redirected to our login and sign-up landing page. The user is first prompted to sign in, with options at the bottom for recovery and creating an account.

If the user is new to our service or needs to create a new account, all they have to do is click the "Create Account" button. The user will then be redirected to the signup page as displayed below.

 After entering some basic information, the user will continue and be redirected to the final sign-in process.

## Streaming Service Sign-in

This stage of sign-in is crucial to the function of our app. Since we are sending playlists through multiple music streaming services, we require the user to log into at least two of the music services that they would like to use with our website. It does not matter which two of the services we offer are logged in and the user is more than welcome to log into more than two. The continue button will not be visible until the user has two services connected to ensure the smooth operation of the website.

After clicking on one of the service buttons, the user will be redirected to a simple login to the respective service as shown below. This example uses Spotify, however, all logins will be the same.

After logging into at least two services, the main sign-in landing page will display a continue button and show the services that have been logged into as greyed out. The user now has the option to continue, or add more services which will repeat the same process.

Finally, the user will be redirected to their homepage. This page will show the user their connected services, as well as the playlists associated with each service. The user can scroll left and right within each service to view more of their playlists.
The user has many options to take from here. If the user has already seen a playlist they would like to transfer, they can select it with a simple click, and then click the add button in the bottom left corner to send that playlist to the transfer cart. (Note: The user will not be able to add playlists from different services into the cart.) 
Additionally, the user has buttons in the top menu bar that will take them to the cart, service login, and their profile page.

If the user has too many playlists and does not want to scroll to the right endlessly, they can click on the service icon to expand it and display the playlists in a much larger window. This larger window will display up to 20 playlists at a time, and if there are more the user can scroll down to the right. The add button carries over to this page so that the user can still send playlists to the transfer cart from here as well.

At any point, the user can double-click on a playlist to view its contents, description, and various other relevant information. The add button carries over to this menu as well to ensure that the user can send playlists to the cart at any given time.

Inside any of these expanded menus, the user can always hit the back button or click on our logo to return to their homepage. The menu bar stays constant at the top for easy navigation.

## Transfer Cart

Once the user is satisfied with the amount of playlists they have sent to the transfer cart, they can click on the cart button in the menu bar to redirect to that page. Here, the user will see all of the playlists they have sent to the cart on the left box, with the service the playlists are coming from at the top. The user will be able to edit the cart by removing some or all of the playlists using the buttons on the right of the playlists or the empty cart button at the bottom. Once the user likes what is in their cart, they can select the service to transfer to from the drop-down menu in the box on the right. The user will then click the button at the bottom of the page to complete the transfer.

The user will be provided with feedback that their transfer has been completed by showing the playlists in the second box as well as the button saying transfer complete.

The user may return to the homepage, and the feedback will be reset so the next transfer can be completed.

## Profile and Preferences Page

If the user would like some personalization to their account, they may visit the profile page by clicking the icon in the top left of the menu bar. Upon visiting this page, the user will be shown two sections. The profile section at the top will show a changeable profile image, as well as relevant stats about the user's account. 
In the bottom preferences section, the user will be able to select settings to tailor the experience to their liking. Additionally, we have added recovery options in case the user needs to reset their password, change their email, or delete their account.
