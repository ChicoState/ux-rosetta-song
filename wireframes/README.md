 After entering some basic information, the user will continue and be redirected to the final sign-in process.

## Streaming Service Sign-in

This stage of sign is is crucial to the function of our app. Since we are sending playlists through multiple music streaming services, we require the user to log into at least two of the music services that they would like to use with our website. It does not matter which two of the servies we offer are logged in and the user is more than welcome to log into more than two. The continue button will not be visible until the user has two services connected to ensure smooth operation of the website.

After clicking on one of the service buttons, the user will be redirected to a simple login to the respective service as shown below. This example uses Spotify, however all logins will be the same.

After logging into at least two services, the main sign in landing page will display a continue button and show the services that have been logged into as greyed out. The user now has the option to continue, or add more services which will repeat the same process.

Finally, the user will be redirected to their own homepage. This page will show the user their connected services, as well as the playlsts associated with each service. The user can scroll left and right within each service to view more of their playlists.
The user has many options to take from here.
