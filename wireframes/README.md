## Rosetta Song Sign-in / Sign-up

After the homepage, our users of Rosetta Song will be redirected to our login and sign up landing page. The user is first propmted to sign in, with options at the bottom for recovery and creating an account.

If the user is new to our service, or needs to create a new account, all they have to do is click the "Create Account" button. The user will then be redirected to the sign up page as displayed below.

 After entering some basic information, the user will continue and be redirected to the final sign-in process.

## Streaming Service Sign-in

This stage of sign is is crucial to the function of our app. Since we are sending playlists through multiple music streaming services, we require the user to log into at least two of the music services that they would like to use with our website. It does not matter which two of the servies we offer are logged in and the user is more than welcome to log into more than two. The continue button will not be visible until the user has two services connected to ensure smooth operation of the website.

After clicking on one of the service buttons, the user will be redirected to a simple login to the respective service as shown below. This example uses Spotify, however all logins will be the same.

After logging into at least two services, the main sign in landing page will display a continue button and show the services that have been logged into as greyed out. The user now has the option to continue, or add more services which will repeat the same process.

Finally, the user will be redirected to their own homepage. This page will show the user their connected services, as well as the playlsts associated with each service. The user can scroll left and right within each service to view more of their playlists.
The user has many options to take from here. If the user has already seen a playlist they would like to transfer, they can select it with a simple click, and then click the add button in the bottom left corner to send that playlist to the transfer cart. (Note: The user will not be able to add playlists from different services into the cart.) 
Additionally, the user has buttons in the top menu bar that will take them to the cart, service login, and their profile page.

If the user has too many playlists and does not want to scroll to the right endlessly, they are able to click on the service icon to expand it and display the playlists in a much larger window. This larger window will display up to 20 playlists at a time, and if there are more the user can scroll down on the right. The add button carries over to this page so that the user can still send palylists to the transfer cart from here as well.

At any point, the user can double click on a playlist to view its contents, description, and various other relevant information. The add button carries over to this menu as well to ensure that the user can send playlists to the cart at any given time.

Inside any of these expanded menus, the user can always hit the back button or click on our logo to return to their homepage. The menu bar stays constant at the top for easy navigation.
